**1. Overview**
The goal of this project is to integrate an AI chatbot with Google Forms to provide real-time feedback to users before submission. A new "Evaluate" button will be added near the "Submit" button. When clicked, the form responses will be sent to an AI model, which will analyze the answers and provide feedback in a popup window. Users can then modify their responses before final submission.

**2. Key Features**
- **Evaluate Button:** A custom button placed near the Submit button.
- **AI Response Analysis:** Answers sent to an AI chatbot for evaluation.
- **Feedback Display:** A popup window will show AI-generated feedback.
- **Editable Responses:** Users can modify answers based on feedback.
- **Final Submission:** Users can submit the form after receiving feedback.

**3. Technical Details**
- **Google Forms Integration:** Using Apps Script to extend Google Forms.
- **Data Handling:** Extract responses via Apps Script.
- **AI Processing:** Send responses to OpenAI API or Google Gemini API.
- **Popup Display:** Use HTMLService to create a modal dialog.
- **Security & Privacy:** Ensure user data is securely transmitted and processed.

**4. User Flow**
1. The user fills out the Google Form.
2. The user clicks "Evaluate" before submitting.
3. Form responses are sent to an AI service.
4. AI analyzes responses and provides feedback.
5. A popup window displays the AI-generated feedback.
6. The user can edit their responses based on feedback.
7. The user clicks "Submit" to finalize the form.

**5. Technology Stack**
- **Google Apps Script** (to handle form processing and AI communication)
- **OpenAI API / Google Gemini API** (for AI response evaluation)
- **HTML + JavaScript** (for popup UI display)

**6. Implementation Steps**
1. **Modify Google Form UI:** Inject a new "Evaluate" button.
2. **Capture Form Responses:** Extract user input data.
3. **Send Data to AI:** Use API calls to process responses.
4. **Generate AI Feedback:** Receive and format AI responses.
5. **Display Feedback in Popup:** Create a modal for feedback.
6. **Allow Response Editing:** Keep form fields editable.
7. **Submit Form:** Standard submission process remains unchanged.

**7. Expected Challenges**
- Google Forms' limitations on UI customization.
- Handling API response times efficiently.
- Ensuring smooth user experience without disrupting the form flow.

**8. Next Steps**
- Review the specification.
- Implement Google Apps Script and AI API integration.
- Test and refine the feedback mechanism.
