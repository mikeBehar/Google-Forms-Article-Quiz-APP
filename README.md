# Google-Forms-Article-Quiz-APP
## **1\. Overview**
Last Modified 01/26/25 6:06 PM
This Add-on will extend a **Google Forms Quiz** to provide both:

1. **Static “Model Answer”** feedback in the native quiz “View Accuracy” page, and  
2. **AI-Generated Feedback** (via an external AI service) sent to each student by email after they submit.

**Key Points:**

* Each question will have a “model answer” stored in the quiz’s **Correct Feedback** field.  
* When a student submits the quiz, the form’s standard behavior shows the “View Accuracy” page, which reveals the model answer feedback.  
* Separately, a server-side script (`onFormSubmit`) will call the AI to compare the student’s response against the model answer, assign a score (1–10), and provide short advice. That feedback is emailed to the student (using Apps Script’s `MailApp`) for private, individualized review.

## **2\. Form Setup & Add-on Behavior**

### **2.1 Google Form (Quiz) Configuration**

1. **Enable Quiz Mode**:  
   * In the form settings, toggle “Make this a quiz.”  
   * Decide if you want to release the grade immediately or manually. (Here, you do **not** plan to “release grade immediately.” The “View Accuracy” page will still show the static model answers.)  
2. **Model Answers in Correct Feedback**:  
   * For each question (short answer, multiple choice, etc.), you’ll enter the “model answer” or explanation in the **Correct Answer Feedback** field.  
   * This ensures the standard “View Accuracy” page will display a single “model answer” to students post-submission.

### **2.2 Form Submission & Student View**

1. **Student Completion**:  
   * The student fills out all quiz items and presses **Submit**.  
   * They see the standard “Your response has been recorded” message and a “View Accuracy” (or “View Score”) button.  
2. **Native Quiz Feedback**:  
   * Upon clicking “View Accuracy,” they see the Google Forms quiz results page, which displays each question and the **Correct Feedback** (i.e., the model answer) for reference.

---

## **3\. AI Feedback Flow**

1. **Trigger: `onFormSubmit(e)`**  
   * Once the student submits, the Add-on’s trigger runs on the server side (no immediate popup is shown to the respondent—this is standard Google Forms behavior).  
2. **AI Comparison**  
   * The script retrieves:  
     * The **student’s response** to each question.  
     * The **model answer** from the question’s Correct Feedback field.  
   * It compiles these pairs into a single prompt and sends it to the AI service.

The prompt can be structured, for instance:  
vbnet  
CopyEdit  
`For each question, compare the student's answer with the model answer.`   
`Provide a short paragraph of feedback and a score (1–10).`   
`Q1: Model Answer = "<...>", Student Answer = "<...>"`  
`Q2: ...`

*   
  * The AI returns a consolidated set of feedback, typically in JSON-like or text-parsed format.  
3. **Email Delivery**  
   * The script sends the AI’s feedback to the student’s email address using `MailApp.sendEmail()`.  
   * This ensures each student receives unique, personalized advice.  
   * The script cwill also log the AI feedback in the linked Google Sheet for instructor reference.

---

## **4\. Technology Stack & Architecture**

1. **Google Forms \+ Quiz Mode**  
   * Native quiz features for storing model answers in Correct Feedback fields.  
   * Standard “View Accuracy” screen for showing the static feedback.  
2. **Google Apps Script (Stand-Alone Add-on)**  
   * **CardService**\-based Add-on with the following components:  
     * A configuration card (accessible to the form owner) if needed to handle any additional settings.  
     * An `onFormSubmit(e)` trigger to handle AI comparison.  
     * `MailApp` usage to send emails to each respondent.  
   * **Script Properties** store the AI API key securely.  
3. **AI Service**  
   * The script calls an external AI API (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) to compare the student’s answer with the model answer and produce a numeric score \+ short textual feedback.

---

## **5\. Detailed User & Editor Flows**

### **5.1 Form Editor Flow**

1. **Enable the Quiz**:  
   * Convert the Google Form into a Quiz under “Settings.”  
2. **Add/Edit Questions**:  
   * For each question, provide the “Correct Answer Feedback” text, which serves as the “model answer.”  
3. **Install/Configure the Add-on**:  
   * In the Form Editor, use the puzzle-piece icon or “Extensions → Add-ons” to manage the Add-on.  
   * Open the Add-on’s configuration card to set your AI model preferences, email format, or any additional data.
   * The AI model choices will be: DeepSeek, Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude.ai

### **5.2 Student (Respondent) Flow**

1. **Complete the Quiz**:  
   * Students see normal question prompts. The “model answers” are hidden until they submit.  
2. **Submit**:  
   * After pressing **Submit**, the standard confirmation screen displays.  
3. **View Accuracy**:  
   * If enabled, the quiz “View Accuracy” screen shows each question with the “Correct Answer Feedback.”  
4. **Receive Email**:  
   * Sometime after submission, the student receives an email from the instructor’s account containing the **AI-generated feedback**.  
   * This feedback compares their unique answers with the model answers, includes a numeric score per question, and short advice on improvements.

---

## **6\. Implementation Details**

1. **Storing the AI Key**  
   * The Add-on must retrieve the AI key from **Script Properties** (or a secure vault).  
   * Never hardcode the API key in the code.  
2. **Generating the AI Prompt**  
   * The `onFormSubmit(e)` function will parse `e.namedValues` or `e.response` for the student’s answers.  
   * For each question item, it will retrieve the quiz’s “Correct Feedback” text.

It compiles a prompt such as:  
vbnet  
CopyEdit  
`Compare each student answer with the model answer from the quiz feedback. Provide:`  
  `- A short paragraph of advice`  
  `- A numeric rating (1–10)`  
`Q1 Student Answer: "..."`  
`Q1 Model Answer: "..."`  
`Q2 Student Answer: "..."`  
`Q2 Model Answer: "..."`  
`...`

*   
  * Submits this prompt to the AI endpoint (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek,  GPT) and parses the response.  
3. **Emailing Results**  
   * Once the feedback is available, the script calls `MailApp.sendEmail()` with the student’s email address.

The subject/body can be formatted to show per-question feedback:  
yaml  
CopyEdit  
`Subject: Your AI Feedback for [Form Title]`  
`Body:`  
  `Hello [Name or Email],`  
  `Here is your personalized AI feedback:`  
    
  `Question 1: Score: ...`  
  `Advice: ...`  
    
  `Question 2: ...`  
    
  `...`  
    
  `Best regards,`  
  `[Instructor / Course Name]`

*   
  * if The form automatically collects email addresses, you can access them in `e.namedValues["Email Address"]` or similar. Otherwise, the student may need to provide their email in a dedicated question.  
4. **Logging Feedback** (Optional)  
   * The script can also write AI feedback to the response row in the linked Google Sheet for teacher review.  
   * For instance, you might create extra columns labeled “AI Score Q1,” “AI Score Q2,” “AI Feedback Q1,” etc., or store a single “AI Feedback (Combined)” cell.  
5. **Error Handling & Quotas**  
   * `MailApp` has daily send limits, typically around 1,500–2,000 messages per day for Google Workspace. For a small class (under 40 students), this is ample.  
   * The AI service might have its own usage quotas.  
   * If the AI call fails, you can handle it gracefully (e.g., send an email stating, “AI feedback not available at this time,” or store an error message).

---

## **7\. Security & Privacy Considerations**

1. **No Sensitive Data**:  
   * The form doesn’t collect regulated information (HIPAA, GDPR-sensitive data), so no special compliance measures are required.  
2. **AI Key Protection**:  
   * Script Properties must be kept private (default for Add-on owners).  
3. **User Data Transmission**:  
   * Student answers are sent to the AI service. This is typically acceptable for standard use.  
   * If any policy changes or domain restrictions apply, you may need to confirm with your institution’s guidelines.

---

## **8\. Usage & Maintenance**

1. **Installation**  
   * You won’t publish publicly. Instead, keep it internal or share within your Google Workspace domain so only your class or co-instructors can install it if needed.  
   * As the form owner, you install the Add-on on each form that needs AI feedback.  
2. **Managing Multiple Forms**  
   * Each form must be in Quiz mode, with correct feedback fields for each question.  
   * The Add-on can be reused across multiple quizzes. You might store the same AI key in the same Add-on instance or set distinct AI model parameters per form if needed.  
3. **Future Enhancements**  
   * Additional card-based configuration for advanced settings (AI model type, additional prompts, custom email templates, etc.).  
   * Logging user feedback in more detail or analyzing results across multiple quizzes.

---

## **9\. Conclusion & Next Steps**

With this specification:

1. **Enable Quiz Mode** and place “model answers” in the Correct Feedback fields.  
2. **Implement** the Add-on code that:  
   * Listens to `onFormSubmit(e)`.  
   * Pulls student answers and model answers.  
   * Calls the AI service.  
   * Emails each student their custom feedback.  
3. **Test** the form with sample submissions. Confirm the “View Accuracy” page shows model answers and that each student receives an email with the AI’s personalized advice.

This design lets students see a basic “model answer” post-submission while also receiving more detailed AI-driven feedback privately. It avoids the complexities of dynamically overwriting feedback fields in the form and doesn’t require hosting a custom web app.

**End of Revised Specification**





++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is  draft #2 Specification as done by GPT Code Copilot

Below is the updated and consolidated specification, incorporating all clarifications and requirements. This should serve as the foundation for the application design and development.

---

## 1. Overview
The goal of this project is to integrate an AI chatbot with Google Forms to provide real-time feedback before final submission. A new "Evaluate" button will be placed near the "Submit" button. When clicked, the user's form responses will be sent to an AI model, which will analyze them based on correctness, completeness, and relevance. The AI will then provide feedback and a numeric score (1–10) in a popup window. Users can revise their answers based on this feedback before submitting the form.
 

## 2. Form Details & Constraints
1. **Number and Type of Questions**  
   - The form will have fewer than 20 questions.  
   - Approximately 80% of these questions will be free-response text.  
   - The remaining questions may be True/False or multiple-choice.
   
2. **Example Question**  
   - A sample prompt might be: "Explain the meaning and use of the term ‘Backpropagation.’”

---

## 3. Key Features
1. **Evaluate Button**  
   - A custom button placed near the standard “Submit” button.  
   - Clicking “Evaluate” triggers AI analysis of the current responses.

2. **AI Response Analysis**  
   - All user responses are sent to an AI service (e.g., OpenAI or Google Gemini) for evaluation based on correctness, completeness, and relevance.  
   - The AI returns both a short paragraph of feedback and a numeric score from 1 to 10.

3. **Feedback Display**  
   - Feedback is presented in a popup window (modal or dialog) that includes:
     - The question prompt (for reference).  
     - The user’s current response.  
     - AI-generated commentary (concise paragraph).  
     - A numeric rating from 1–10.  
   - The window will have scroll bars to handle longer content.

4. **Editable Responses**  
   - After reviewing the feedback, users can close the popup and adjust their answers directly in the form.  
   - Users can click “Evaluate” multiple times to refine their responses.

5. **Final Submission & Data Storage**  
   - When satisfied, the user clicks “Submit.”  
   - The form entries, along with the AI-generated score and feedback, are stored in the resulting Google Form response spreadsheet for future reference.

---

## 4. Technical Details
1. **Google Forms Integration**  
   - Implemented using **Google Apps Script** to intercept form data.  
   - The script will be a **standalone script file** rather than container-bound.

2. **Data Handling**  
   - Use Apps Script to extract and compile user responses.  
   - Append the AI’s feedback and score to the user’s final form submission, which is recorded in the associated Google Sheet.

3. **AI Processing**  
   - Connect to the AI service (OpenAI or Google Gemini) via HTTP requests from Apps Script.  
   - Store API keys securely in **Script Properties** (no hardcoding).

4. **Popup Display**  
   - Powered by **HTMLService** to create a custom modal or dialog window.  
   - Must support scrolling to view lengthy feedback.  
   - Contains a “thinking” indicator that updates every 10 seconds to reflect that the AI is still processing. Once the AI response is ready, the content area is cleared and replaced with the final feedback.

5. **Security & Privacy**  
   - No sensitive or regulated data is collected via the form, so no special compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) is required.  
   - Data is stored in the Google ecosystem, and no external storage is required beyond the AI service call.  
   - Script sharing is restricted so that only the owner can access or edit the code.

---

## 5. User Flow
1. **Fill Out the Form**  
   - The user answers up to 20 questions (primarily short free-response, some T/F or multiple choice).

2. **Click “Evaluate”**  
   - Form responses are compiled and sent to the AI.  
   - The popup/modal displays a progress message indicating the AI is working, updated every 10 seconds with a timestamp.

3. **Receive AI Feedback**  
   - Feedback (short paragraph) and a 1–10 score is displayed.  
   - The user can scroll through the feedback if it is lengthy.

4. **Revise Responses (Optional)**  
   - The user may close the popup and modify their answers.  
   - They can re-click “Evaluate” any number of times.

5. **Submit the Form**  
   - After final edits, the user clicks “Submit.”  
   - The user’s answers and the AI-generated feedback are stored in the Google Sheet tied to the form.

---

## 6. Technology Stack
- **Google Apps Script**  
  - Standalone script file for form extension and AI integration.  
  - Handles form data extraction, AI communication, and final data storage.

- **OpenAI API / Google Gemini API**  
  - For AI-based evaluation and feedback generation.

- **HTML + JavaScript (HTMLService in Apps Script)**  
  - For building the popup/modal UI and updating “thinking” messages.

---

## 7. Usage & Performance
1. **Class Size**  
   - Designed for a small class of under 40 students.  
   - Expected usage remains relatively low-volume.

2. **Performance Expectations**  
   - No strict requirement on speed, but a visual “thinking” indicator should provide user feedback while the AI generates results.

---

## 8. Timeline & Next Steps
1. **Implementation**  
   - Develop the standalone Apps Script with custom form triggers and the Evaluate button.  
   - Test the AI request flow, including the “thinking” indicator in the popup.

2. **Testing**
