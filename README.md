# Google-Forms-Article-Quiz-APP
This is  draft #2 Specification as done by GPT Code Copilot

Below is the updated and consolidated specification, incorporating all clarifications and requirements. This should serve as the foundation for the application design and development.

---

## 1. Overview
The goal of this project is to integrate an AI chatbot with Google Forms to provide real-time feedback before final submission. A new "Evaluate" button will be placed near the "Submit" button. When clicked, the user's form responses will be sent to an AI model, which will analyze them based on correctness, completeness, and relevance. The AI will then provide feedback and a numeric score (1–10) in a popup window. Users can revise their answers based on this feedback before submitting the form.
 

## 2. Form Details & Constraints
1. **Number and Type of Questions**  
   - The form will have fewer than 20 questions.  
   - Approximately 80% of these questions will be free-response text.  
   - The remaining questions may be True/False or multiple-choice.
   
2. **Example Question**  
   - A sample prompt might be: "Explain the meaning and use of the term ‘Backpropagation.’”

## 3. Key Features
1. **Evaluate Button**  
   - A custom button placed near the standard “Submit” button.  
   - Clicking “Evaluate” triggers AI analysis of the current responses.

2. **AI Response Analysis**  
   - All user responses are sent to an AI service (e.g., OpenAI or Google Gemini) for evaluation based on correctness, completeness, and relevance.  
   - The AI returns both a short paragraph of feedback and a numeric score from 1 to 10.

3. **Feedback Display**  
   - Feedback is presented in a popup window (modal or dialog) that includes:
     - The question prompt (for reference).  
     - The user’s current response.  
     - AI-generated commentary (concise paragraph).  
     - A numeric rating from 1–10.  
   - The window will have scroll bars to handle longer content.

4. **Editable Responses**  
   - After reviewing the feedback, users can close the popup and adjust their answers directly in the form.  
   - Users can click “Evaluate” multiple times to refine their responses.

5. **Final Submission & Data Storage**  
   - When satisfied, the user clicks “Submit.”  
   - The form entries, along with the AI-generated score and feedback, are stored in the resulting Google Form response spreadsheet for future reference.

## 4. Technical Details
1. **Google Forms Integration**  
   - Implemented using **Google Apps Script** to intercept form data.  
   - The script will be a **standalone script file** rather than container-bound.

2. **Data Handling**  
   - Use Apps Script to extract and compile user responses.  
   - Append the AI’s feedback and score to the user’s final form submission, which is recorded in the associated Google Sheet.

3. **AI Processing**  
   - Connect to the AI service (OpenAI or Google Gemini) via HTTP requests from Apps Script.  
   - Store API keys securely in **Script Properties** (no hardcoding).

4. **Popup Display**  
   - Powered by **HTMLService** to create a custom modal or dialog window.  
   - Must support scrolling to view lengthy feedback.  
   - Contains a “thinking” indicator that updates every 10 seconds to reflect that the AI is still processing. Once the AI response is ready, the content area is cleared and replaced with the final feedback.

5. **Security & Privacy**  
   - No sensitive or regulated data is collected via the form, so no special compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) is required.  
   - Data is stored in the Google ecosystem, and no external storage is required beyond the AI service call.  
   - Script sharing is restricted so that only the owner can access or edit the code.

## 5. User Flow
1. **Fill Out the Form**  
   - The user answers up to 20 questions (primarily short free-response, some T/F or multiple choice).

2. **Click “Evaluate”**  
   - Form responses are compiled and sent to the AI.  
   - The popup/modal displays a progress message indicating the AI is working, updated every 10 seconds with a timestamp.

3. **Receive AI Feedback**  
   - Feedback (short paragraph) and a 1–10 score is displayed.  
   - The user can scroll through the feedback if it is lengthy.

4. **Revise Responses (Optional)**  
   - The user may close the popup and modify their answers.  
   - They can re-click “Evaluate” any number of times.

5. **Submit the Form**  
   - After final edits, the user clicks “Submit.”  
   - The user’s answers and the AI-generated feedback are stored in the Google Sheet tied to the form.

## 6. Technology Stack
- **Google Apps Script**  
  - Standalone script file for form extension and AI integration.  
  - Handles form data extraction, AI communication, and final data storage.

- **OpenAI API / Google Gemini API**  
  - For AI-based evaluation and feedback generation.

- **HTML + JavaScript (HTMLService in Apps Script)**  
  - For building the popup/modal UI and updating “thinking” messages.

---

## 7. Usage & Performance
1. **Class Size**  
   - Designed for a small class of under 40 students.  
   - Expected usage remains relatively low-volume.

2. **Performance Expectations**  
   - No strict requirement on speed, but a visual “thinking” indicator should provide user feedback while the AI generates results.

---

## 8. Timeline & Next Steps
1. **Implementation**  
   - Develop the standalone Apps Script with custom form triggers and the Evaluate button.  
   - Test the AI request flow, including the “thinking” indicator in the popup.

2. **Testing**  
   - Gather feedback from a small user group (the class) to refine UI and adjust feedback length if needed.

3. **Deployment**  
   - Finalize sharing settings for the standalone script.  
   - Provide the form link to students.
